In this project I have designed a Library database management system.

•	Developed a relational database schema to model the library's structure, including tables for books, users, transactions, and administrative functions by implementing SQL queries for data manipulation, retrieval, and management, ensuring optimal performance and data integrity.
•	Skills: SQL (Structured Query Language), Database Management System (DBMS).
